# Lab2. Implementation of Basic Quantum Computing Algorithms: Superdense Coding, Teleporation, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazarani, Simon

In this lab, you will implement and analyze three foundational quantum algorithms using Qiskit. You will:

* Learn fundamentals about Superdense coding and teleportation.
* Start with the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, where you’ll determine if a function is constant or balanced using only a single query — showcasing the power of quantum parallelism.
* Explore the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which efficiently recovers a hidden binary string using interference patterns in quantum circuits.
* Dive into Simon’s algorithm, an early demonstration of exponential speedup over classical methods, where you’ll uncover a secret string by analyzing entangled states and collecting multiple measurements.

Throughout this lab, you will develop practical skills in quantum circuit construction, oracle design, measurement analysis, and interpreting results from quantum simulators.
